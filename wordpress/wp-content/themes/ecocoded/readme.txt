The Internet contributes two percent of global carbon emissions. The internet is beautiful but data transfer requires electricity that creates carbon emissions & contributes to climate change. With sustainability at its core, EcoCoded is a low-impact WordPress theme. The internet is not eco-friendly; let's help each other reduce carbon emissions. We use a few colors to minimize your visitor’s device power usage, load only one font, and have reduced & compressed the code. There are no fancy animations or frameworks integrated. We recommend using as few images as possible on your website, avoiding videos, and using a green hosting service. The theme is fully search engine optimized (SEO), lightweight, and responsive. It works with most plugins and page builders, such as Elementor. You can still use advertisement services, such as AdSense. The EcoCoded is simple and doesn't contain too many features; it's a beginner-friendly theme. The theme has basic accessibility features integrated, such as tab navigation and skip-to-content. If you have any ideas about reducing carbon emission further through a theme, please reach out to us. We'll implement all ideas. Use EcoCoded, and let's take sustainability to a whole other level!
